	possible and is the recommended way.

	bbdoc: Displays page @x.
	about: This is THE important method - it is used to display the help in application.
	<p>
	You can specify the page in many ways:
	<ul>
	<li>as direct filename of HTML document </li>
	<li>as chapter name (from contents) or as a book name</li>
	<li>as some word from index </li>
	<li>even as any word (will be searched)</li>
	</ul>
	Looking for the page runs in these steps:
	<ol>
	<li>try to locate file named x (if x is for example "doc/howto.htm") </li>
	<li>try to open starting page of book named x </li>
	<li>try to find x in contents (if x is for example "How To ...") </li>
	<li>try to find x in index (if x is for example "How To ...") </li>
	<li>switch to Search panel and start searching </li>
	</ul>

	End Rem
	Method DisplayIndex()
		bmx_wxhtmlhelpcontroller_displayindex(wxObjectPtr)
	End Method
	
	Rem
	bbdoc: Displays help window, focuses search panel and starts searching.
	about: Returns true if the keyword was found. Optionally it searches through the index
	(mode = wxHELP_SEARCH_INDEX), default the content (mode = wxHELP_SEARCH_ALL).
	<p>
	Important: KeywordSearch searches only pages listed in .hhc file(s). You should list all pages in the contents file.
	</p>

	End Method
	
	Rem
	bbdoc: Sets the path for storing temporary files - cached binary versions of index and contents files.
	about: These binary forms are much faster to read. Default value is empty string
	(empty string means that no cached data are stored). Note that these files are not
	deleted when program exits.
	<p>
	Once created these cached files will be used in all subsequent executions of your
	application. If cached files become older than corresponding .hhp file (e.g. if you
	regenerate documentation) it will be refreshed.
	</p>

	Rem
	bbdoc: Sets format of title of the frame.
	about: Must contain exactly one "%s" (for title of displayed HTML page).
	End Rem
	Method SetTitleFormat(format:String)
		bmx_wxhtmlhelpcontroller_settitleformat(wxObjectPtr, format)
	End Method
	
	Rem
	bbdoc: Associates config object with the controller.
	about: If there is associated config object, wxHtmlHelpController automatically reads
	and writes settings (including wxHtmlWindow's settings) when needed.
	<p>
	The only thing you must do is create wxConfig object and call UseConfig.
	</p>
	<p>
	If you do not use UseConfig, wxHtmlHelpController will use default wxConfig object if
	available (for details see wxConfigBase::Get and wxConfigBase::Set).
	</p>
