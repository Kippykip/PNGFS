bbdoc: Provides a generic, ground-up implementation of a text control capable of showing multiple styles and images.
about: wxRichTextCtrl sends notification events: see wxRichTextEvent. It also sends the standard
wxTextCtrl events wxEVT_COMMAND_TEXT_ENTER and wxEVT_COMMAND_TEXT_UPDATED, and wxTextUrlEvent when
URL content is clicked.
End Rem

	Rem
	bbdoc: Begins applying a left indent and subindent in tenths of a millimetre.
	The sub-indent is an offset from the left of the paragraph, and is used for all but the first line in a paragraph. A positive value will cause the first line to appear to the left of the subsequent lines, and a negative value will cause the first line to be indented relative to the subsequent lines.
	wxRichTextBuffer uses indentation to render a bulleted item. The left indent is the distance between the margin and the bullet. The content of the paragraph, including the first line, starts at leftMargin + leftSubIndent. So the distance between the left edge of the bullet and the left of the actual paragraph is leftSubIndent.
	end rem
	Method BeginLeftIndent:Int(leftIndent:Int, leftSubIndent:Int = 0)

	Rem

	bbdoc: Begins a numbered bullet. This call will be needed for each item in the list, and the application should take care of incrementing the numbering.
	bulletNumber is a number, usually starting with 1.
	leftIndent and leftSubIndent are values in tenths of a millimetre.

wxRichTextStyleListBox::wxRICHTEXT_STYLE_CHARACTER and wxRichTextStyleListBox::wxRICHTEXT_STYLE_LIST
to set the current view. Associate the control with a style sheet and rich text control with SetStyleSheet
