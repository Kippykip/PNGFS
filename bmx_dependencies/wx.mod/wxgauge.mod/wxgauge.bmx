bbdoc: A gauge is a horizontal or vertical bar which shows a quantity (often time).
about: wxGauge supports two working modes: determinate and indeterminate progress.
<p>
The first is the usual working mode (see SetValue and SetRange) while the second can be used when the program is
doing some processing but you don't know how much progress is being done. In this case, you can periodically call
the Pulse function to make the progress bar switch to indeterminate mode (graphically it's usually a set of blocks
which move or bounce in the bar control).
</p>
<p>
wxGauge supports dynamic switching between these two work modes.
</p>
<p>
There are no user commands for the gauge.
