bbdoc: Presents the user with a choice of fonts and a grid of available characters.
about: This modal dialog provides the application with a selected symbol and optional font
selection.
<p>
Although this dialog is contained in the rich text library, the dialog is generic and can be
used in other contexts.
</p>
<p>
To use the dialog, pass a default symbol specified as a string, an initial font name, and a
current font name. The difference between the initial font and current font is that the
initial font determines what the font control will be set to when the dialog shows - an empty
string will show the selection normal text. The current font, on the other hand, is used by
the dialog to determine what font to display the characters in, even when no initial font is
selected. This allows the user (and application) to distinguish between inserting a symbol in
the current font, and inserting it with a specified font.
</p>
<p>
When the dialog is dismissed, the application can get the selected symbol with GetSymbol and
test whether a font was specified with UseNormalFont, fetching the specified font with
GetFontName.
</p>
