' Here is a two page example with header, footer and logo: 
'
' This example makes use of the Header() and Footer() methods to process page
' headers and footers. They are called automatically. They already exist in the
' wxPdfDocument class but do nothing, therefore we have to extend the class and override
' them. 
' 
' The logo is printed with the Image() method by specifying its upper-left corner
' and its width. The height is calculated automatically to respect the image
' proportions. 
' 
' To print the page number, a null value is passed as the cell width. It means
' that the cell should extend up to the right margin of the page; it is handy to
' center text. The current page number is returned by the PageNo() method; as for
' the total number of pages, it is obtained by means of the special value {nb}
' which will be substituted on document closure (provided you first called
' AliasNbPages()). 
' 
' Note the use of the SetY() method which allows to set position at an absolute
' location in the page, starting from the top or the bottom. 

' Another interesting feature is used here: the automatic page breaking. As soon
' as a cell would cross a limit in the page (at 2 centimeters from the bottom by
' default), a break is performed and the font restored. Although the header and
' footer select their own font (Arial), the body continues with Times. This mechanism
' of automatic restoration also applies to colors and line width. The limit which
' triggers page breaks can be set with SetAutoPageBreak().
