bbdoc: wxSystemOptions stores option/value pairs that wxWidgets itself or applications can use to alter behaviour at run-time.
about: It can be used to optimize behaviour that doesn't deserve a distinct API, but is still
important to be able to configure.
<p>These options are currently recognised by wxWidgets.</p>
<h3>Windows</h3>
<table width="90%" align="center">
<tr><th>Option</th><th>Value</th></tr>
<tr><td>no-maskblt</td><td>1 to never use WIN32's MaskBlt function, 0 to allow it to be used where
possible. Default: 0. In some circumstances the MaskBlt function can be slower than using the fallback
code, especially if using DC cacheing. By default, MaskBlt will be used where it is implemented by the
operating system and driver.</td></tr>
<tr><td>msw.remap</td><td>If 1 (the default), wxToolBar bitmap colours will be remapped to the current
theme's values. Set this to 0 to disable this functionality, for example if you're using more than 16
colours in your tool bitmaps. </td></tr>
<tr><td>msw.window.no-clip-children</td><td>If 1, windows will not automatically get the WS_CLIPCHILDREN
style. This restores the way windows are refreshed back to the method used in versions of wxWidgets
earlier than 2.5.4, and for some complex window hierarchies it can reduce apparent refresh delays. You
may still specify wxCLIP_CHILDREN for individual windows. </td></tr>
<tr><td>msw.notebook.themed-background</td><td>If set to 0, globally disables themed backgrounds on
notebook pages. Note that this won't disable the theme on the actual notebook background (noticeable
only if there are no pages). </td></tr>
<tr><td>msw.staticbox.optimized-paint</td><td>If set to 0, switches off optimized wxStaticBox painting.
Setting this to 0 causes more flicker, but allows applications to paint graphics on the parent of a
static box (the optimized refresh causes any such drawing to disappear). </td></tr>
<tr><td>msw.display.directdraw</td><td>If set to 1, use DirectDraw-based implementation of wxDisplay.
By default the standard Win32 functions are used. </td></tr>
<tr><td>msw.font.no-proof-quality</td><td>If set to 1, use default fonts quality instead of proof
quality when creating fonts. With proof quality the fonts have slightly better appearance but not
all fonts are available in this quality, e.g. the Terminal font in small sizes is not and this
option may be used if wider fonts selection is more important than higher quality. </td></tr>
</table>
<h3>Linux</h3>
<table width="90%" align="center">
<tr><th>Option</th><th>Value</th></tr>
<tr><td>gtk.window.force-background-colour</td><td>If 1, the backgrounds of windows with the wxBG_STYLE_COLOUR
background style are cleared forcibly instead of relying on the underlying GTK+ window colour.
This works around a display problem when running applications under KDE with the gtk-qt theme
installed (0.6 and below).</td></tr>
</table>
<h3>Mac</h3>
<table width="90%" align="center">
<tr><th>Option</th><th>Value</th></tr>
<tr><td>mac.window-plain-transition</td><td>If 1, uses a plainer transition when showing a window.
You can also use the symbol wxMAC_WINDOW_PLAIN_TRANSITION.</td></tr>
<tr><td>window-default-variant</td><td>The default variant used by windows (cast to integer from the
wxWindowVariant enum). Also known as wxWINDOW_DEFAULT_VARIANT. </td></tr>
<tr><td>mac.listctrl.always_use_generic</td><td>Tells wxListCtrl to use the generic control even when
it is capable of using the native control instead. Also knwon as wxMAC_ALWAYS_USE_GENERIC_LISTCTRL.</td></tr>
