bbdoc: wxTextDataObject is a specialization of wxDataObject for text data.
about: It can be used without change to paste data into the wxClipboard or a wxDropSource.
A user may wish to derive a new class from this class for providing text on-demand in order to minimize memory
consumption when offering data in several formats, such as plain text and RTF because by default the text is
stored in a string in this class, but it might as well be generated when requested. For this, GetTextLength
and GetText will have to be overridden.
<p>
Note that if you already have the text inside a string, you will not achieve any efficiency gain by overriding these
functions because copying wxStrings is already a very efficient operation (data is not actually copied because
wxStrings are reference counted).
</p>
<p>
<b>NOTE</b : this does not currently support overriding in BlitzMax (TODO)
