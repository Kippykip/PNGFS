bbdoc: The wxApp type represents the application itself.
about: It is used to:
<ul>
<li>set and get application-wide properties</li>
<li>implement the windowing system message or event loop</li>
<li>initiate application processing via wxApp::OnInit</li>
<li>allow default processing of events not handled by other objects in the application.</li>
</ul>
End Rem
Type wxApp Extends wxEvtHandler Abstract

	Global app:wxApp
	
	Method New()
		If Not app Then
			app = Self
		End If
	End Method

	Rem
	bbdoc: This must be provided by the application, and will usually create the application's main window, optionally calling wxApp::SetTopWindow.
	about: You may use OnExit to clean up anything initialized here, provided that the method returns true.
	<p>
	Notice that if you want to to use the command line processing provided by wxWidgets you have to call the
	base type version in the derived type OnInit().
	</p>
	<p>
	Return true to continue processing, false to exit the application immediately.
	</p>
	End Rem
	Method OnInit:Int() Abstract

	Function _OnInit:Int() { nomangle }
		app.wxObjectPtr = bmx_app_getapp()
		Return app.OnInit()
	End Function

	Rem
	bbdoc: Override this method for any processing which needs to be done as the application is about to exit.
	about: OnExit is called after destroying all application windows and controls, but before wxWidgets cleanup.
	Note that it is not called at all if OnInit failed.
	<p>
	The return value of this method is currently ignored, return the same value as returned by the base class
	method if you override it.
	</p>
	End Rem
	Method OnExit:Int()

	End Rem
	Method EntryStart:Int()
		Return bmx_app_wxentrystart()
	End Method
	
	Rem
	bbdoc: Sets the 'top' window.
	about: You can call this from within wxApp::OnInit to let wxWidgets know which is the main window.
	You don't have to set the top window; it is only a convenience so that (for example) certain dialogs without
	parents can use a specific window as the top window. If no top window is specified by the application,
	wxWidgets just uses the first frame or dialog in its top-level window list, when it needs to use the top window.
	End Rem
	Method SetTopWindow(window:wxWindow)
		bmx_wxapp_settopwindow(window.wxObjectPtr)
	End Method
	
	Rem
	bbdoc: Returns the top window
	about: If the top window hasn't been set using wxApp::SetTopWindow, this method will
	find the first top-level window (frame or dialog) and return that.
	End Rem
	Method GetTopWindow:wxWindow()
		Return wxWindow(wxWindow._find(bmx_wxapp_gettopwindow()))
	End Method
	
	Rem
	bbdoc: Sets the name of the application.
	about: The name may be used in dialogs (for example by the document/view framework). A default name is set by
	wxWidgets.
	End Rem
	Method SetAppName(name:String)
		bmx_wxapp_setappname(name)
	End Method
	
	Rem
	bbdoc: Returns the application name.
	about: wxWidgets sets this to a reasonable default before calling wxApp::OnInit, but the application can reset it at will.
	End Rem
	Method GetAppName:String()
		Return bmx_wxapp_getappname()
	End Method
	
	Rem
	bbdoc: Sets the application name to be used in the user-visible places such as window titles.
	about: See #GetAppDisplayName() for more about the differences between the display name and name.
	Notice that if this function is called, the name is used as is, without any capitalization as done by default by #GetAppDisplayName().
	End Rem
	Method SetAppDisplayName(name:String)
		bmx_wxapp_setappdisplayname(name)
	End Method
	
	Rem
	bbdoc: Returns the user-readable application name.
	about: The difference between this string and the one returned by #GetAppName() is that this one is meant to be shown
	to the user and so should be used for the window titles, page headers and so on while the other one should be only used
	internally, e.g. for the file names or configuration file keys.

	If the application name for display had been previously set by #SetAppDisplayName(), it will be returned by this function.
	Otherwise, if #SetAppName() had been called its value will be returned; also as is. Finally if none was called, this function
	returns the program name capitalized using wxString::Capitalize().
	End Rem
	Method GetAppDisplayName:String()
		Return bmx_wxapp_getappdisplayname()
	End Method
	
	Rem
	bbdoc: Returns the application's vendor name.
	End Rem
	Method SetVendorName(name:String)
		bmx_wxapp_setvendorname(name)
	End Method
	
	Rem
	bbdoc: Returns the application's vendor name.
	End Rem
	Method GetVendorName:String()
		Return bmx_wxapp_getvendorname()
	End Method
	
	Rem
	bbdoc: Allows the programmer to specify whether the application will exit when the top-level frame is deleted.
	End Rem
	Method SetExitOnFrameDelete(flag:Int)
		bmx_wxapp_setexitonframedelete(flag)
	End Method
	
	Rem
	bbdoc: Returns true if the application is active, i.e. if one of its windows is currently in the foreground.
	about: If this method returns false and you need to attract users attention to the application,
	you may use wxTopLevelWindow::RequestUserAttention to do it.
	End Rem
	Method IsActive:Int()
		Return bmx_wxapp_isactive()
	End Method
	
	Rem
	bbdoc: Yields control to pending messages in the windowing system.
	about: This can be useful, for example, when a time-consuming process writes to a text window.
	Without an occasional yield, the text window will not be updated properly, and on systems with
	cooperative multitasking, such as Windows 3.1 other processes will not respond.
	<p>
	Caution should be exercised, however, since yielding may allow the user to perform actions which
	are not compatible with the current task. Disabling menu items or whole menus during processing
	can avoid unwanted reentrance of code: see ::wxSafeYield for a better function.
	</p>
	<p>
	Note that Yield() will not flush the message logs. This is intentional as calling Yield() is
	usually done to quickly update the screen and popping up a message box dialog may be undesirable.
	If you do wish to flush the log messages immediately (otherwise it will be done during the next
	idle loop iteration), call wxLog::FlushActive.
	</p>
	<p>
	Calling Yield() recursively is normally an error and an assert failure is raised in debug build
	if such situation is detected. However if the onlyIfNeeded parameter is true, the method will just
	silently return false instead.
	</p>
	End Rem

		Return bmx_wxapp_yield(onlyIfNeeded)

interaction.

Rem
bbdoc: This function wakes up the (internal and platform dependent) idle system.
about: It will force the system to send an idle event even if the system currently is idle and thus would not send
any idle event until after some other event would get sent. This is also useful for sending events between two
threads and is used by the corresponding functions ::wxPostEvent and wxEvtHandler::AddPendingEvent.
