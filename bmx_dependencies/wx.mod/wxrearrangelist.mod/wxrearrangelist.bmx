bbdoc: A listbox-like control allowing the user to rearrange the items and to enable or disable them. 
about: This type allows to change the order of the items shown in it as well as to check or uncheck them
individually. The data structure used to allow this is the order array which contains the items indices
indexed by their position with an added twist that the unchecked items are represented by the bitwise
complement of the corresponding index (for any architecture using two's complement for negative numbers
representation (i.e. just about any at all) this means that a checked item N is represented by -N-1 in
unchecked state). In practice this means that you must apply the bitwise complement operator when constructing
the order array, e.g.
<pre>
        Local order:Int[2] 
        order[0] = 0  ' checked item #0
        order[1] = ~1 ' unchecked item #1
</pre>
So, for example, the array order [1 -3 0] used in conjunction with the items array
["first", "second", "third"] means that the items order is "second", "third", "first"
and the "third" item is unchecked while the other two are checked.
<p>
This convention is used both for the order argument of the control ctor or CreateList() and for the array
returned from GetCurrentOrder().
</p>
<p>
Usually this control will be used together with other controls allowing to move the items around in it
interactively. The simplest possible solution is to use wxRearrangeCtrl which combines it with two standard
buttons to move the current item up or down.
