bbdoc: This type manages up to two subwindows.
about: The current view can be split into two programmatically (perhaps from a menu command), and unsplit
either programmatically or via the wxSplitterWindow user interface.

<p><b>Event Handling</b>
<ul>
<li><tt>wxEVT_COMMAND_SPLITTER_SASH_POS_CHANGING</tt> - The sash position is in the process of being changed.
May be used to modify the position of the tracking bar to properly reflect the position that would be set
if the drag were to be completed at this point.</li>
<li><tt>wxEVT_COMMAND_SPLITTER_SASH_POS_CHANGED</tt> - The sash position was changed. May be used to modify
the sash position before it is set, or to prevent the change from taking place.</li>
<li><tt>wxEVT_COMMAND_SPLITTER_UNSPLIT</tt> - The splitter has been just unsplit.</li>
<li><tt>wxEVT_COMMAND_SPLITTER_DOUBLECLICKED</tt> - The sash was double clicked. The default behaviour is to
unsplit the window when this happens (unless the minimum pane size has been set to a value greater than zero).</li>
</ul>

	about: After using the constructor, you must create either one or two subwindows with the splitter

	and wxSplitterWindow::SplitHorizontally in order to set the pane(s).

	Rem
	bbdoc: This method replaces one of the windows managed by the wxSplitterWindow with another one.
	about: It is in general better to use it instead of calling Unsplit() and then resplitting the window
	back because it will provoke much less flicker (if any). It is valid to call this function whether
	the splitter has two windows or only one.
	<p>
	Both parameters should be non-NULL and winOld must specify one of the windows managed by the splitter.
	If the parameters are incorrect or the window couldn't be replaced, false is returned. Otherwise the
	function will return true, but please notice that it will not delete the replaced window and you may wish
	to do it yourself.

	bbdoc: Sets the sash gravity.
	about: Gravity is real factor which controls position of sash while resizing wxSplitterWindow.
	Gravity tells wxSplitterWindow how much will left/top window grow while resizing.
	<p>
	Example values: 
	<ul>
	<li>0.0 - only the bottom/right window is automatically resized</li>
	<li>0.5 - both windows grow by equal size </li>
	<li>1.0 - only left/top window grows </li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
	Gravity should be a real value between 0.0 and 1.0.
	</p>
	<p>
	Default value of sash gravity is 0.0.

	End Method
	
	Rem
	bbdoc: Sets the sash size.
	about: Normally, the sash size is determined according to the metrics of each platform, but the
	application can override this, for example to show a thin sash that the user is not expected to
	drag. If size is more -1, the custom sash size will be used.
	End Rem
	Method SetSashSize(size:Int)
		bmx_wxsplitterwindow_setsashsize(wxObjectPtr, size)
	End Method
	
	Rem
	bbdoc: Sets the minimum pane size.
	about: The default minimum pane size is zero, which means that either pane can be reduced to zero
	by dragging the sash, thus removing one of the panes. To prevent this behaviour (and veto out-of-range
	sash dragging), set a minimum size, for example 20 pixels. If the wxSP_PERMIT_UNSPLIT style is
	used when a splitter window is created, the window may be unsplit even if minimum size is non-zero.

		End If
	End Method
	
	Rem
	bbdoc: Causes any pending sizing of the sash and child panes to take place immediately.
	about: Such resizing normally takes place in idle time, in order to wait for layout to be completed.
	However, this can cause unacceptable flicker as the panes are resized after the window has been shown.
	To work around this, you can perform window layout (for example by sending a size event to the parent
	window), and then call this function, before showing the top-level window.

bbdoc: This type represents the events generated by a splitter control.
about: Also there is only one event type, the data associated to the different events is not the same
and so not all accessor functions may be called for each event. The documentation mentions the kind of
event(s) for which the given accessor function makes sense: calling it for other types of events will
result in assert failure (in debug mode) and will return meaningless results.
