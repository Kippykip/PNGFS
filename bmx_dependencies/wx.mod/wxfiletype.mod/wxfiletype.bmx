bbdoc: This type holds information about a given file type.
about: File type is the same as MIME type under Unix, but under Windows it corresponds more to an extension than to MIME type
(in fact, several extensions may correspond to a file type).
<p>
This object may be created in several different ways: the program might know the file extension and wish to find out the corresponding MIME type or,
conversely, it might want to find the right extension for the file to which it writes the contents of given MIME type. Depending on how it was
created some fields may be unknown so the return value of all the accessors must be checked: false will be returned if the corresponding information couldn't be found.
</p>
<p>
The objects of this class are never created by the application code but are returned by wxMimeTypesManager::GetFileTypeFromMimeType and
wxMimeTypesManager::GetFileTypeFromExtension methods.
</p>
