bbdoc: This type makes it easy to tell your user that the program is temporarily busy. 
about: Just create a wxBusyInfo object, and a message window will be shown. When you are done. Call Free().
<p>
For example:
<pre>
Local wait:wxBusyInfo = New wxBusyInfo.Create("Please wait, working...")

For Local i:Int = 0 Until 100000
	DoACalculation()
Next

wait.Free()
</pre>
</p>
<p>
It works by creating a window in the constructor, and deleting it in the destructor.
</p>
<p>
You may also want to call wxGetApp().Yield() to refresh the window periodically (in case it had been obscured
by other windows, for example) like this:
<pre>
Local wait:wxBusyInfo = New wxBusyInfo.Create("Please wait, working...")

For Local i:Int = 0 Until 100000
	DoACalculation()
	If i Mod 1000 = 0 Then
		wxGetApp().Yield()
	End if
Next

wait.Free()
</pre>
</p>
