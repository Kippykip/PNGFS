bbdoc: The wxScrolledWindow manages scrolling for its client area, transforming the coordinates according to the scrollbar positions, and setting the scroll positions, thumb sizes and ranges according to the area in view.
about: There are three ways to set the size of the scrolling area:
<p>
One way is to set the scrollbars directly using a call to wxScrolledWindow::SetScrollbars. This is the way it
used to be in any previous version of wxWidgets and it will be kept for backwards compatibility.
</p>
<p>
An additional method of manual control, which requires a little less computation of your own, is to set the total
size of the scrolling area by calling either wxWindow::SetVirtualSize, or wxWindow::FitInside, and setting the
scrolling increments for it by calling wxScrolledWindow::SetScrollRate. Scrolling in some orientation is enabled
by setting a non-zero increment for it.
</p>
<p>
The most automatic and newest way is to simply let sizers determine the scrolling area. This is now the default
when you set an interior sizer into a wxScrolledWindow with wxWindow::SetSizer. The scrolling area will be set
to the size requested by the sizer and the scrollbars will be assigned for each orientation according to the need
for them and the scrolling increment set by wxScrolledWindow::SetScrollRate. As above, scrolling is only enabled in
orientations with a non-zero increment. You can influence the minimum size of the scrolled area controlled by a
sizer by calling wxWindow::SetVirtualSizeHints. (calling wxScrolledWindow::SetScrollbars has analogous effects in
wxWidgets 2.4 -- in later versions it may not continue to override the sizer)
</p>
<p>
Note: if Maximum size hints are still supported by SetVirtualSizeHints, use them at your own dire risk. They may or
may not have been removed for 2.4, but it really only makes sense to set minimum size hints here. We should probably
replace SetVirtualSizeHints with SetMinVirtualSize or similar and remove it entirely in future.
</p>
<p>
As with all windows, an application can draw onto a wxScrolledWindow using a device context.
</p>
<p>
You have the option of handling the OnPaint handler or overriding the OnDraw function, which is passed a pre-scrolled
device context (prepared by DoPrepareDC).
</p>
<p>
If you don't wish to calculate your own scrolling, you must call DoPrepareDC when not drawing from within OnDraw, to
set the device origin for the device context according to the current scroll position.
</p>
<p>
A wxScrolledWindow will normally scroll itself and therefore its child windows as well. It might however be desired
to scroll a different window than itself: e.g. when designing a spreadsheet, you will normally only have to scroll
the (usually white) cell area, whereas the (usually grey) label area will scroll very differently. For this special
purpose, you can call SetTargetWindow which means that pressing the scrollbars will scroll a different window.
</p>
<p>
Note that the underlying system knows nothing about scrolling coordinates, so that all system functions (mouse events,
expose events, refresh calls etc) as well as the position of subwindows are relative to the "physical" origin of the
scrolled window. If the user insert a child window at position (10,10) and scrolls the window down 100 pixels
(moving the child window out of the visible area), the child window will report a position of (10,-90).

	DoPrepareDC is called automatically within the default wxScrolledWindow::OnPaint event handler, so your
	wxScrolledWindow::OnDraw override will be passed a 'pre-scrolled' device context. However, if you wish to
	draw from outside of OnDraw (via OnPaint), or you wish to implement OnPaint yourself, you must call this
	function yourself. For example:
	<pre>
	Function OnEvent(event:wxEvent)
	    Local dc:wxClientDC(wxWindow(event.parent))
	    DoPrepareDC(dc)
	
	    dc.SetPen(wxBLACK_PEN())
	
	    Local x:Int, y:Int
	    wxMouseEvent(event).GetPosition(x, y)
	
	    If xpos > -1 And ypos > -1 And wxMouseEvent(event).Dragging() Then
	        dc.DrawLine(xpos, ypos, x, y)
