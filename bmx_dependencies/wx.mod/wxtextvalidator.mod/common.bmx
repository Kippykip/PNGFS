Rem
bbdoc: No filtering takes place.
End Rem
Const wxFILTER_NONE:Int = $000

Rem
bbdoc: Empty strings are filtered out.
about: If this style is not specified then empty strings are accepted only if they pass the other checks (if you use more than one wxTextValidatorStyle).
End Rem
Const wxFILTER_EMPTY:Int = $001

Rem
bbdoc: Non-ASCII characters are filtered out.
End Rem
Const wxFILTER_ASCII:Int = $002

Rem
bbdoc: Non-alpha characters are filtered out.
about: Uses the wxWidgets wrapper for the standard CRT function isalpha (which is locale-dependent) on all characters of the string.
End Rem
Const wxFILTER_ALPHA:Int = $004

Rem
bbdoc: Non-alphanumeric characters are filtered out.
about: Uses the wxWidgets wrapper for the standard CRT function isalnum (which is locale-dependent) on all characters of the string.
End Rem

Rem
bbdoc: Non-numeric characters are filtered out.
about: Uses the wxWidgets wrapper for the standard CRT function isdigit (which is locale-dependent) on all characters of the string.
End Rem
Const wxFILTER_DIGITS:Int = $010

Rem
bbdoc: Non-numeric characters are filtered out.
about: Works like wxFILTER_DIGITS but allows also decimal points, minus/plus signs and the 'e' or 'E' character to input exponents. Note that this is not the same behaviour of wxString::IsNumber().

Rem
bbdoc: Use an include list.
about: The validator checks if the user input is on the list, complaining if not. See wxTextValidator::SetIncludes().
End Rem
Const wxFILTER_INCLUDE_LIST:Int = $040

Rem
bbdoc: Use an include list.
about: The validator checks if each input character is in the list (one character per list element), complaining if not. See wxTextValidator::SetCharIncludes().
End Rem
Const wxFILTER_INCLUDE_CHAR_LIST:Int = $080

Rem
bbdoc: Use an exclude list.
about: The validator checks if the user input is on the list, complaining if it is. See wxTextValidator::SetExcludes().

Rem
