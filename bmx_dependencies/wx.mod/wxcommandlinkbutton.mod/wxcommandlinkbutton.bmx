bbdoc: Objects of this type are similar in appearance to the normal wxButtons but are similar to the links in a web page in functionality.
about: Pressing such button usually results in switching to another window of the program and so they can be used as a replacement for the "Next" button
in a multi-page dialog (such as wxWizard), for example.
<p>
Their advantage compared to the ordinary wxButtons is that they emphasize the action of switching the window and also that they allow to give more
detailed explanation to the user because, in addition to the short button label, they also show a longer description string.
</p>
<p>
The short, title-like, part of the label is called the main label and the longer description is the note. Both of them can be set and queried
independently using wxCommandLinkButton-specific methods such as SetMainLabel() or GetNote() or also via SetLabel() and GetLabel() methods
inherited from wxButton. When using the latter, the main label and the note are concatenated into a single string using a new line character
between them (notice that the note part can have more new lines in it).
</p>
<p>
wxCommandLinkButton generates the same event as wxButton but doesn't support any of wxButton-specific styles nor adds any new styles of its own.
</p>
<p>
Currently this class uses native implementation under Windows Vista and later versions and a generic implementation for the other platforms and earlier Windows versions.
