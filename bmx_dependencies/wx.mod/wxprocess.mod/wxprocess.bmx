bbdoc: The objects of this class are used in conjunction with the wxExecute function.
about: When a wxProcess object is passed to wxExecute(), its OnTerminate() virtual method is called
when the process terminates. This allows the program to be (asynchronously) notified about the
process termination and also retrieve its exit status which is unavailable from wxExecute() in
the case of asynchronous execution.
<p>
Please note that if the process termination notification is processed by the parent, it is responsible
for deleting the wxProcess object which sent it. However, if it is not processed, the object will
delete itself and so the library users should only delete those objects whose notifications have
been processed (and call Detach() for others).
</p>
<p>
wxProcess also supports IO redirection of the child process. For this, you have to call its Redirect
method before passing it to wxExecute. If the child process was launched successfully, GetInputStream,
GetOutputStream and GetErrorStream can then be used to retrieve the streams corresponding to the
child process standard output, input and error output respectively.
</p>

	Rem
	bbdoc: Constructs a process object.
	about: @id is only used in the case you want to use wxWidgets events. It identifies this
	object, or another window that will receive the event.
	<p>
	If the @parent parameter is not Null, it will receive a wxEVT_END_PROCESS notification event
	(you should connect a wxEVT_END_PROCESS function to the parent to handle it)
	with the given id.
	End Rem

	Rem
	bbdoc: Creates an object without any associated parent (and hence no id neither) but allows to specify the flags which can have the value of wxPROCESS_DEFAULT or wxPROCESS_REDIRECT.
	about: Specifying the former value has no particular effect while using the latter one is
	equivalent to calling Redirect.

	Rem
	bbdoc: Creates an object without any associated parent (and hence no id neither) but allows to specify the flags which can have the value of wxPROCESS_DEFAULT or wxPROCESS_REDIRECT.

	Rem
	bbdoc: Closes the output stream (the one connected to the stdin of the child process).
	about: This method can be used to indicate to the child process that there is no more
	data to be read - usually, a filter program will only terminate when the input stream
	is closed.
	End Rem
	Method CloseOutput()
		bmx_wxprocess_closeoutput(wxObjectPtr)
	End Method
	
	Rem
	bbdoc: Normally, a wxProcess object is deleted by its parent when it receives the notification about the process termination.
	about: However, it might happen that the parent object is destroyed before the external process
	is terminated (e.g. a window from which this external process was launched is closed by the
	user) and in this case it should not delete the wxProcess object, but should call Detach() instead.
	After the wxProcess object is detached from its parent, no notification events will be sent
	to the parent and the object will delete itself upon reception of the process termination
	notification.
	End Rem

		Return wxInputStream._create(bmx_wxprocess_geterrorstream(wxObjectPtr))
	End Method
	
	Rem
	bbdoc: It returns an input stream corresponding to the standard output stream of the subprocess.
	about: If it is NULL, you have not turned on the redirection. See wxProcess::Redirect.

	Rem
	bbdoc: Returns true if there is data to be read on the child process standard output stream.
	about: This allows to write simple (and extremely inefficient) polling-based code waiting
	for a better mechanism in future wxWidgets versions.
	End Rem
	Method IsInputAvailable:Int()

	Rem
	bbdoc: This function replaces the standard popen() function: it launches the process specified by the cmd parameter and returns the wxProcess object which can be used to retrieve the streams connected to the standard input, output and error output of the child process.
	about: If the process couldn't be launched, NULL is returned. Note that the process object will be destroyed automatically when
	the child process terminates. This does mean that the child process should be told to quit
	before the main program exits to avoid memory leaks.

	Rem
	bbdoc: Turns on redirection.
	about: wxExecute will try to open a couple of pipes to catch the subprocess stdio. The caught
	input stream is returned by GetOutputStream() as a non-seekable stream. The caught output
	stream is returned by GetInputStream() as a non-seekable stream.
	End Rem

about: Please notice that doing this requires the corresponding access rights (superuser under Unix, SE_SHUTDOWN
privilege under Windows NT) and that this function is only implemented under Unix and Win32.
