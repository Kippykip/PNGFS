bbdoc: A type for manipulating the clipboard.
about: Note that this is not compatible with the clipboard class from wxWidgets 1.xx, which has the same
name but a different implementation.
<p>
Call wxClipboard::Open to get ownership of the clipboard. If this operation returns true,
you now own the clipboard. Call wxClipboard::SetData to put data on the clipboard, or
wxClipboard::GetData to retrieve data from the clipboard. Call wxClipboard::Close to close
the clipboard and relinquish ownership. You should keep the clipboard open only momentarily.
</p>
<p>
To receive (paste in usual terminology) data from the clipboard, you should create a wxDataObject derived type which
supports the data formats you need and pass it as argument to wxClipboard::GetData. If it returns false,
no data in (any of) the supported format(s) is available. If it returns true, the data has been successfully
transferred to the wxDataObject.
</p>
