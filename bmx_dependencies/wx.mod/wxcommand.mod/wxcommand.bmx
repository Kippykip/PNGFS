bbdoc: wxCommand is a base type for modelling an application command, which is an action usually performed by selecting a menu item, pressing a toolbar button or any other means provided by the application to change the data or view.

	<p>
	How you implement this command is totally application dependent, but typical strategies include:
	<ul>
	<li>
	Perform an inverse operation on the last modified piece of data in the document. When redone, a
	copy of data stored in command is pasted back or some operation reapplied. This relies on the
	fact that you know the ordering of Undos; the user can never Undo at an arbitrary position
	in the command history. 
	</li>
	<li>
	Restore the entire document state (perhaps using document transactioning). Potentially very
	inefficient, but possibly easier to code if the user interface and data are complex, and an
	'inverse execute' operation is hard to write. 
	</li>
	<</ul>
