bbdoc: This type represents a target for a drag and drop operation.
about: A wxDataObject can be associated with it and by default, this object will be filled with the data from the drag
source, if the data formats supported by the data object match the drag source data format.
<p>
There are various virtual handler functions defined in this class which may be overridden to give visual
feedback or react in a more fine-tuned way, e.g. by not accepting data on the whole window area, but only
a small portion of it. The normal sequence of calls is OnEnter, possibly many times OnDragOver, OnDrop and finally OnData.
