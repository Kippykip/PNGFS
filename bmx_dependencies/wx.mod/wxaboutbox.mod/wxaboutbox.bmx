bbdoc: This function shows the standard about dialog containing the information specified in info.
about: If the current platform has a native about dialog which is capable of showing all the fields in info,
the native dialog is used, otherwise the function falls back to the generic wxWidgets version of the dialog,
i.e. does the same thing as wxGenericAboutBox().
End Rem
Function wxAboutBox(info:wxAboutDialogInfo)
	bmx_wxaboutbox(info.wxAboutDialogInfoPtr)
End Function

Rem
bbdoc: wxAboutDialogInfo contains information shown in the standard About dialog displayed by the wxAboutBox() function.
about: This type contains the general information about the program, such as its name, version, copyright and so on,
as well as lists of the program developers, documentation writers, artists and translators. The simple properties
from the former group are represented as a string with the exception of the program icon and the program web site,
while the lists from the latter group are stored as wxArrayString and can be either set entirely at once using
SetDevelopers and similar functions or built one by one using AddDeveloper etc.
<p>
Please also notice that while all the main platforms have the native implementation of the about dialog, they are
often more limited than the generic version provided by wxWidgets and so the generic version is used if
wxAboutDialogInfo has any fields not supported by the native version. Currently GTK+ version supports all the
possible fields natively but MSW and Mac versions don't support URLs, licence text nor custom icons in the about
dialog and if either of those is used, wxAboutBox() will automatically use the generic version so you should avoid
specifying these fields to achieve more native look and feel.

	bbdoc: Adds a translator name to be shown in the program credits.
	about: Notice that if no translator names are specified explicitely, wxAboutBox() will try to use the
	translation of the string translator-credits from the currently used message catalog -- this can be used to
	show just the name of the translator of the program in the current language.

	Rem
	bbdoc: Set the short string containing the program copyright information.
	about: Notice that any occurrences of "(C)" in copyright will be replaced by the copyright symbol (circled C)
	automatically, which means that you can avoid using this symbol in the program source code which can be
	problematic.

	bbdoc: Set the icon to be shown in the dialog.
	about: By default the icon of the main frame will be shown if the native about dialog supports custom icons.
	If it doesn't but a valid icon is specified using this method, the generic about dialog is used instead so
	you should avoid calling this function for maximally native look and feel.

	Rem
	bbdoc: Set the long, multiline string containing the text of the program licence.
	about: Only GTK+ version supports showing the licence text in the native about dialog currently so the
	generic version will be used under all the other platforms if this method is called. To preserve the native
	look and feel it is advised that you do not call this method but provide a separate menu item in the "Help"
	menu for displaying the text of your program licence.

		bmx_wxaboutdialoginfo_setversion(wxAboutDialogInfoPtr, version)
	End Method
	
	Rem
	bbdoc: Set the web site for the program and its description (which defaults to URL itself if empty).
	about: Please notice that only GTK+ version currently supports showing the link in the native about dialog so
	if this method is called, the generic version will be used under all the other platforms.
