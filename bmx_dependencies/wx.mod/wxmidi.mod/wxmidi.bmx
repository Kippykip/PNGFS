it provides a timestamp value that is used by devices involved in MIDI timing, such as

	of staus values goes from 0x80 to 0xFF.
	<p>
	Values lower than 0xF0 identify channel messages, with the four lower bits specifying the channel (0-15); for example, status byte 0x93 is a NoteOn for channel 3:

bbdoc: Object wxMidiSysExMessage represents a system-exclusive MIDI message.
about: As the MIDI specification allows that sysex messages be interrupted by real-time messages, the wxMidi package
takes care of this and ensures that any real-time messsage embeded into a sysex message will be delivered first. Also
it ensures that when a sysex message is delivered it is complete and does not contain real-time messages embeded into
it.
<p>
The sysex message encapsulated in a wxMidiSysExMessage will normally be terminated by an EOX status byte (0xF7), but
this can not be guaranteed. If the last byte of a received wxMidiSysExMessage is not an EOX it means the sysex
message was somehow truncated. This is not considered an error, as a missing EOX can result from the user
disconnecting a MIDI cable during sysex transmission.
</p>
<p>
The timestamp of a wxMidiSysExMessage is the time at which the status byte (the first byte of the message) arrived.

bbdoc: The base interface for devices is wxMidiDevice.
about: It is an abstract class with two derived classes: wxMidiInDevice and wxMidiOutDevice
<p>
A wxMidiDevice object represents a MIDI stream on which MIDI data traffic can be read or sent. All
MIDI communication is achieved through a wxMidiDevice by using MIDI messages. Devices can be opened
and closed, and they provide descriptions of themselves.
</p>
<p>
MIDI messages are represented by the wxMidiMessage abstract class and are read and sent from/to the
MIDI stream by using methods Read and Write, respectively.
</p>
<p>
For the most common output operations, such as note on or note off, there are specific methods
implemented so that wxMidi user has not to build and send the appropriate messages. See: NoteOn,
NoteOff, ProgramChange, AllSoundsOff.

	MIDI note 60, middle C # is 61, middle D is 62, and so on.</li>
	<li>@velocity - Velocity refers to how hard the key, on a MIDI keyboard, was pressed. This parameter controls
	the volume of the sound to be produced. So you can consider velocity as synonimous with volume. Parameter
	@velocity is a value from 0 to 127. A logarithmic scale is recommended, for example:
	<TABLE>
	<TR><TD>OFF</TD><TD> ppp</TD><TD>pp</TD><TD> p</TD><TD>mp</TD><TD>mf</TD><TD>f</TD><TD>ff</TD><TD>fff</TD></TR>

	You must be aware that in MIDI systems, the activation of a particular note and the release of the same note are

bbdoc: The General MIDI (GM) Specification, published by the International MIDI Association, defines a set of general capabilities for General MIDI Instruments.
about: The General MIDI Specification includes the definition of a General MIDI Sound Set
(a patch map), a General MIDI Percussion map (mapping of percussion sounds to note numbers),
and a set of General MIDI Performance capabilities (number of voices, types of MIDI messages
recognized, etc.).
<p>
A MIDI sequence which has been generated for use on a General MIDI Instrument should play
correctly on any General MIDI synthesizer or sound module.
</p>
<p>
The wxMidi package has a database with the General Midi standard (GM) instruments list.
Instruments are grouped into sections, to facilitate the user to search for a specific
instrument. The database includes methods to populate a combo box, a list box and, in
general, any other control derived from wxControlWithItems.
</p>
<p>
wxMidiSystem is a singleton and, therefore, the constructor is not public. Access to the
only instance must be through method GetInstance.
</p>
<p>
The General MIDI system specifies which instrument or sound corresponds with each
program/patch number, but General MIDI does not specify how these sounds are produced.
Thus, program number 0 should select the Acoustic Grand Piano sound on any General MIDI
instrument. However, the Acoustic Grand Piano sound on two General MIDI synthesizers which
use different synthesis techniques may sound quite different.
</p>
<p>
The General MIDI system utilizes MIDI channels 0-8 and 10-15 for chromatic instrument
sounds, while channel number 9 is utilized for "key-based" percussion sounds.
</p>
<p>
For sounds on channels 0-8 and 10-15, the note number in a NoteOn message is used to select
the pitch of the sound which will be played. For example if the Vibraphone instrument
(program number 11) has been selected on channel 2, then playing note number 60 on channel
2 would play the middle C note (this would be the default note to pitch assignment on most
instruments), and note number 59 on channel 2 would play B below middle C. Both notes would
be played using the Vibraphone sound.
</p>
<p>
The General MIDI system specifies sounds (or instruments, in wxMidi terminilogy) by using
program numbers 0 through 127. The list of all these 128 sounds could be obtained by
using different methods; for example, by calling PopulateWithAllInstruments.
</p>
<p>
These instrument sounds are grouped into "sets" of related sounds. For example, instruments
0-7 are piano sounds, 8-15 are chromatic percussion sounds, 16-23 are organ sounds, 24-31
are guitar sounds, etc. Each one of these "sets" is called a "section" in the
wxMidiDatabaseGM. There are two specific methods to deal with sections: GetNumSections,
GetSectionName and PopulateWithSections.
</p>
<p>
The list of instruments in a section is available through method PopulateWithInstruments .
</p>
<p>
As said, channel 9 reserved for "key-based" percussion sounds. For these "key-based" sounds,
the note number data in a NoteOn message is used differently. Note numbers on channel 9
are used to select which drum sound will be played. For example, a NoteOn message on channel
9 with note number 60 will play a Hi Bongo drum sound. Note number 59 on channel 9 will
play the Ride Cymbal 2 sound. The list of all key-based percussion sounds is accesible
trhough method PopulateWithPercusionInstr
</p>
<p>
The wxMidiDatabaseGM object includes additional methods for retrieving an instrumen name
given its number or the number of the section and the index inside the section. See, for
example, GetInstrFromSection, GetInstrumentName, GetNumInstrumentsInSection
