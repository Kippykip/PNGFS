bbdoc: Represents a background log window.
about: To be precise, it collects all log messages in the log frame which it manages but also passes
them on to the log target which was active at the moment of its creation.
<p>
This allows you, for example, to show all the log messages in a frame but still continue to process them normally by showing the standard log dialog.
