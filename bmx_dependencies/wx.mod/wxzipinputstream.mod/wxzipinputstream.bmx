bbdoc: Input stream for reading zip files.
about: GetNextEntry() returns an wxZipEntry object containing the meta-data for the next entry in the zip (and
gives away ownership). Reading from the wxZipInputStream then returns the entry's data. Eof() becomes true after
an attempt has been made to read past the end of the entry's data. When there are no more entries, GetNextEntry()
returns NULL and sets Eof().
<p>
Note that in general zip entries are not seekable, and wxZipInputStream::SeekI() always returns wxInvalidOffset.
