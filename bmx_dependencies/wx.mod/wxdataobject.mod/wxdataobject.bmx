bbdoc: A wxDataObject represents data that can be copied to or from the clipboard, or dragged and dropped.
about: The important thing about wxDataObject is that this is a 'smart' piece of data unlike 'dumb' data
containers such as memory buffers or files. Being 'smart' here means that the data object itself should know
what data formats it supports and how to render itself in each of its supported formats.
<p>
A supported format, incidentally, is exactly the format in which the data can be requested from a data
object or from which the data object may be set. In the general case, an object may support different formats
on 'input' and 'output', i.e. it may be able to render itself in a given format but not be created from data on
this format or vice versa.
