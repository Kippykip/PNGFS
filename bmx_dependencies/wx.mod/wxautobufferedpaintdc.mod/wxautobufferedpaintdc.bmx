bbdoc: This wxDC derivative can be used inside of an OnPaint() event handler to achieve double-buffered drawing.
about: Just create an object of this class instead of wxPaintDC and make sure wxWindow::SetBackgroundStyle is called
with wxBG_STYLE_CUSTOM somewhere in the class initialization code, and that's all you have to do to (mostly)
avoid flicker.
<p>
The difference between wxBufferedPaintDC and this class, is the lightweigthness - on platforms which have native
double-buffering, wxAutoBufferedPaintDC is simply a typedef of wxPaintDC. Otherwise, it is a typedef of
wxBufferedPaintDC.
