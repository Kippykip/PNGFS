bbdoc: wxMediaCtrl is a type for displaying types of media, such as videos, audio files, natively through native codecs.
about: wxMediaCtrl uses native backends to render media, for example on Windows there is a
ActiveMovie/DirectShow backend, and on Macintosh there is a QuickTime backend.
<p>
By default, wxMediaCtrl will scale the size of the video to the requested amount passed to its constructor. After calling wxMediaCtrl::Load
or performing an equivilant operation, you can subsequently obtain the "real" size of the video (if there is any) by calling
wxMediaCtrl::GetBestSize(). Note that the actual result on the display will be slightly different when wxMediaCtrl::ShowPlayerControls is
activated and the actual video size will be less then specified due to the extra controls provided by the native toolkit. In addition, the
backend may modify wxMediaCtrl::GetBestSize() to include the size of the extra controls - so if you want the real size of the video just
disable wxMediaCtrl::ShowPlayerControls().
</p>
<p>
The idea with setting wxMediaCtrl::GetBestSize() to the size of the video is that GetBestSize() is a wxWindow-derived function that is
called when sizers on a window recalculate. What this means is that if you use sizers by default the video will show in its original size
without any extra assistance needed from the user.
</p>
<p>
Normally, when you use wxMediaCtrl it is just a window for the video to play in. However, some toolkits have their own media player interface.
For example, QuickTime generally has a bar below the video with a slider. A special feature available to wxMediaCtrl, you can use the
toolkits interface instead of making your own by using the ShowPlayerControls() function. There are several options for the flags parameter, with
the two general flags being wxMEDIACTRLPLAYERCONTROLS_NONE which turns off the native interface, and wxMEDIACTRLPLAYERCONTROLS_DEFAULT which
lets wxMediaCtrl decide what native controls on the interface. Be sure to review the caveats outlined in Video size before doing so.

	native controls provided by the underlying toolkit at will using ShowPlayerControls(). Simply calling the function with default
	parameters tells wxMediaCtrl to use the default controls provided by the toolkit. The method takes a wxMediaCtrlPlayerControls enumeration,
	please see available show modes there.
