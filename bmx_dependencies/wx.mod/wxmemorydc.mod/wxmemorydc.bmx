bbdoc: A memory device context provides a means to draw graphics onto a bitmap.
about: When drawing in to a mono-bitmap, using wxWHITE, wxWHITE_PEN and wxWHITE_BRUSH will draw the
background colour (i.e. 0) whereas all other colours will draw the foreground colour (i.e. 1).
End Rem
Type wxMemoryDC Extends wxDC

	Rem
	bbdoc: Constructs a new memory device context.
	about: Use the IsOk() method to test whether the constructor was successful in creating a usable device
	context. Don't forget to select a bitmap into the DC before drawing on it.
	End Rem
	Method Create:wxMemoryDC()
		wxObjectPtr = bmx_wxmemorydc_create()
		Return Self
	End Method

	Rem
	bbdoc: Works exactly like SelectObjectAsSource but this is the method you should use when you select a bitmap because you want to modify it, e.g. drawing on this DC.
	about: Be careful to use this method and not SelectObjectAsSource when you want to modify the bitmap you
	are selecting otherwise you may incur in some problems related to wxBitmap being a reference counted object.
	End Rem
	Method SelectObject(bitmap:wxBitmap)
		bmx_wxmemorydc_selectobject(wxObjectPtr, bitmap.wxObjectPtr)
	End Method

	Rem
	bbdoc: Selects the given bitmap into the device context, to use as the memory bitmap.
	about: Selecting the bitmap into a memory DC allows you to draw into the DC (and therefore the bitmap)
	and also to use wxDC::Blit to copy the bitmap to a window. For this purpose, you may find wxDC::DrawIcon
	easier to use instead.
	<p>
	If the argument is wxNullBitmap (or some other uninitialised wxBitmap) the current bitmap is selected out of
	the device context, and the original bitmap restored, allowing the current bitmap to be destroyed safely.
