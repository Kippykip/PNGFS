bbdoc: wxSingleInstanceChecker type allows to check that only a single instance of a program is running.
about: To do it, you should create an object of this type. As long as this object is alive, calls to
IsAnotherRunning() from other processes will return true.
<p>
As the object should have the life span as big as possible, it makes sense to create it either as a global
or in wxApp::OnInit. For example:
<pre>
Method OnInit:Int()
    Local name:String = "MyApp-" + wxGetUserId() 
    
    m_checker = new wxSingleInstanceChecker.Create(name)
    
    If m_checker.IsAnotherRunning() Then 
        wxLogError(_("Another program instance is already running, aborting.")) 
        Return False
    End If
    ... more initializations ... 
    Return True
End Method
</pre>
</p>
<p>
Note, that you should call Free() before the termination of your application, so that any locked file resources
are also freed up on the system.
</p>
