bbdoc: This type encapsulates the functionality of printing out an application document.
about: A new type must be derived and methods overridden to respond to calls such as OnPrintPage and HasPage
and to render the print image onto an associated wxDC. Instances of this type are passed to wxPrinter::Print
or to a wxPrintPreview object to initiate printing or previewing.
<p>
Your derived wxPrintout is responsible for drawing both the preview image and the printed page. If your
windows' drawing routines accept an arbitrary DC as an argument, you can re-use those routines within your
wxPrintout sub-type to draw the printout image. You may also add additional drawing elements within your
wxPrintout sub-type, like headers, footers, and/or page numbers. However, the image on the printed page will
often differ from the image drawn on the screen, as will the print preview image -- not just in the presence
of headers and footers, but typically in scale. A high-resolution printer presents a much larger drawing
surface (i.e., a higher-resolution DC); a zoomed-out preview image presents a much smaller drawing surface
(lower-resolution DC). By using the routines FitThisSizeToXXX() and/or MapScreenSizeToXXX() within your
wxPrintout sub-type to set the user scale and origin of the associated DC, you can easily use a single
drawing routine to draw on your application's windows, to create the print preview image, and to create
the printed paper image, and achieve a common appearance to the preview image and the printed page.

	about: By default this returns 1, 32000 for the page minimum and maximum values, and 1, 1 for the

	Rem
	bbdoc: Returns the size of the printer page in pixels, called the page rectangle.
	about: The page rectangle has a top left corner at (0,0) and a bottom right corner at (w,h).
	These values may not be the same as the values returned from wxDC::GetSize; if the printout is being
	used for previewing, a memory device context is used, which uses a bitmap size reflecting the current
	preview zoom. The application must take this discrepancy into account if previewing is to be supported.
	End Rem

	End Method
	
	Rem
	bbdoc: Returns the rectangle that corresponds to the entire paper in pixels, called the paper rectangle.
	about: This distinction between paper rectangle and page rectangle reflects the fact that most
	printers cannot print all the way to the edge of the paper. The page rectangle is a rectangle whose
	top left corner is at (0,0) and whose width and height are given by wxDC::GetPageSizePixels.
	On MSW and Mac, the page rectangle gives the printable area of the paper, while the paper rectangle
	represents the entire paper, including non-printable borders. Thus, the rectangle returned by
	GetPaperRectPixels will have a top left corner whose coordinates are small negative numbers and the
	bottom right corner will have values somewhat larger than the width and height given by
	wxDC::GetPageSizePixels. On other platforms and for PostScript printing, the paper is treated as if
	its entire area were printable, so this function will return the same rectangle as the page rectangle.

	Rem
	bbdoc: Returns the number of pixels per logical inch of the printer device context.
	about: Dividing the printer PPI by the screen PPI can give a suitable scaling factor for drawing text
	onto the printer. Remember to multiply this by a scaling factor to take the preview DC size into
	account. Or you can just use the FitThisSizeToXXX() and MapScreenSizeToXXX routines below, which do
	most of the scaling calculations for you.

	about: Returning false signifies the end of the document. By default, HasPage behaves as if the

	Rem
	bbdoc: Set the user scale and device origin of the wxDC associated with this wxPrintout so that the given image size fits entirely within the paper and the origin is at the top left corner of the paper.
	about: Note that with most printers, the region around the edges of the paper are not printable so
	that the edges of the image could be cut off. Use this if you're managing your own page margins.
	End Rem
	Method FitThisSizeToPaper(w:Int, h:Int)

	End Method
	
	Rem
	bbdoc: Set the user scale and device origin of the wxDC associated with this wxPrintout so that the given image size fits entirely within the page rectangle and the origin is at the top left corner of the page rectangle.
	about: On MSW and Mac, the page rectangle is the printable area of the page. On other platforms and
	PostScript printing, the page rectangle is the entire paper. Use this if you want your printed image
	as large as possible, but with the caveat that on some platforms, portions of the image might be cut
	off at the edges.

	Rem
	bbdoc: Set the user scale and device origin of the wxDC associated with this wxPrintout so that the given image size fits entirely within the page margins set in the given wxPageSetupDialogData object.
	about: This method provides the greatest consistency across all platforms because it does not depend on
	having access to the printable area of the paper. Note that on Mac, the native wxPageSetupDialog does
	not let you set the page margins; you'll have to provide your own mechanism, or you can use the Mac-only
	type wxMacPageMarginsDialog.
	End Rem
	Method FitThisSizeToPageMargins(w:Int, h:Int, pageSetupData:wxPageSetupDialogData)

	Rem
	bbdoc: Set the user scale and device origin of the wxDC associated with this wxPrintout so that the printed page matches the screen size as closely as possible and the logical origin is in the top left corner of the paper rectangle.
	about: That is, a 100-pixel object on screen should appear at the same size on the printed page.
	(It will, of course, be larger or smaller in the preview image, depending on the zoom factor.) Use this
	if you want WYSIWYG behavior, e.g., in a text editor.
	End Rem
	Method MapScreenSizeToPaper()
		bmx_wxprintout_mapscreensizetopaper(wxObjectPtr)
	End Method
	
	Rem
	bbdoc: This sets the user scale of the wxDC assocated with this wxPrintout to the same scale as MapScreenSizeToPaper but sets the logical origin to the top left corner of the page rectangle.
	End Rem
	Method MapScreenSizeToPage()
		bmx_wxprintout_mapscreensizetopage(wxObjectPtr)
	End Method
	
	Rem
	bbdoc: This sets the user scale of the wxDC assocated with this wxPrintout to the same scale as MapScreenSizeToPageMargins but sets the logical origin to the top left corner of the page margins specified by the given wxPageSetupDialogData object.
	End Rem
	Method MapScreenSizeToPageMargins(pageSetupData:wxPageSetupDialogData)
		bmx_wxprintout_mapscreensizetopagemargins(wxObjectPtr, pageSetupData.wxObjectPtr)
	End Method
	
	Rem
	bbdoc: Set the user scale and device origin of the wxDC associated with this wxPrintout so that one screen pixel maps to one device pixel on the DC.
	about: That is, the user scale is set to (1,1) and the device origin is set to (0,0). Use this if you
	want to do your own scaling prior to calling wxDC drawing calls, for example, if your underlying model
	is floating-point and you want to achieve maximum drawing precision on high-resolution printers. (Note
	that while the underlying drawing model of Mac OS X is floating-point, wxWidgets's drawing model scales
	from integer coordinates.) You can use the GetLogicalXXXRect() routines below to obtain the paper rectangle,
	page rectangle, or page margins rectangle to perform your own scaling.
